\AtlasAbstract{%
  A search for decays of the Higgs boson to a $Z$ boson and a light resonance in two lepton plus jet events, using the full Run 2 (2015-2018) dataset of 139~fb$^{-1}$ is presented. The target resonance is an $a^0$ from the Two Higgs Doublet Model, or a $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$, which decays hadronically. Due to its low mass and high boost, the resonance is reconstructed as a single jet of hadrons, while the $Z$ boson is reconstructed as a dilepton system. A multivariate event selection based on a Multi-Layer Perceptron is followed by a single-bin profile likelihood fit. In the absence of a signal, 95\% $CL_s$ upper limits on $\sigma(H) \text{BR}(H\to Za^0) / \sigma_\text{SM}(H)$ are set, with values starting from $16.8~\text{pb}$ for the signal hypothesis of a 0.5~GeV $a^0$ decaying to gluons, and $105~\text{pb}$ and $107~\text{pb}$ for the $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$, respectively.
