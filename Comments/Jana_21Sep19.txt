Dear Jana,

Many thanks for taking the time to read this note, and for your very helpful comments. Please find our replies below.

All the best,
Andy, Elliot and Kostas


Section 3.3
In lines 440-442 you describe how you define the single MLP cut defined on all the signal samples:
"with each signal sample weighted by how much the a mass phase space is closer to that signal
sample than to any other".
I'm afraid this does not read very well and what you do is not clear.
>>>>> Reworded.

Table 6 shows that the MLP cut really not work well for the 8 GeV sample, the background
efficiency is higher than the signal efficiency. It would be good to comment in the text
why this is no problem.
>>>>> Done.

Section 4.2.1
Fig 16 (b) shows the striking mismodelling of the high ntracks tail, which is not solved
by the reweighting. I guess this is because for ntracks>=9 these events all go to the same bin?
It would be good to comment on this mismodelling in the text and why this is no problem.
>>>>> One bin is used for ntracks>=9. This is no problem because the MLP has a very low efficiency for these events, and text has been added to explain this.

Section 4.2.3, where you validate the bkg model, you have nice comparisons of data to bkg in the
signal-depleted regions (especially Fig 21), but only with the statistical uncertainties.
Could you add the systematics here?
>>>>> Done.

Section 6.1 has several broken section references.
>>>>> Thank you very much! This is now fixed.

Fig 24 and 27, the x-axis labelling of the NPs is too small to be readable, please increase the font size.
>>>>> Done.

Section 5.1.7, you comment on the uncertainty on the VBF acceptance, but what about VH production ?
>>>>> This uncertainty is understood to be very small, and so the VBF process is used as a proxy for all non-ggF processes to simplify its estimation. Even if the VH systematic was 10x larger than estimated with this proxy, the impact on the signal uncertainty would be 0.34%, which has a negligible impact on the sensitivity.

The correlation plots Fig 25 (Fig 28) show strong correlations of mu with
alpha_MUR_SIG_SR1 (alpha_MUR_BKGD_SR1). Could you explain what are those uncertainties?
>>>>> Descriptions added to the systematics sections.
